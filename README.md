`domainverifier-dotnet`  is a .NET library project designed to simplify domain name ownership verification. 

It consists of two projects: `DomainVerifier` and `DomainVerifier.Extensions`. 

The `DomainVerifier` project is a .NET Standard 2.1 project that is compatible with .NET Core 3.0 to .NET 8. It provides core functionalities for generating domain verification codes and verifying domain ownership.

The `DomainVerifier.Extensions` project provides integration with [Dependency Injection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection) and is compatible with .NET 6, 7, and 8.

## DomainVerifier (the core library)

### Installation

```console
dotnet add package DomainVerifier
```

> [!NOTE]  
> This package is specifically designed for integration with .NET projects running versions earlier than 6.0

If you are working with a .NET 6, 7, or 8 web or  Api application, please install the `DomainVerifier.Extensions` package instead like follow:

```console
dotnet add package DomainVerifier.Extensions
```

### Overview

The `DomainVerifier` project includes a `DnsRecordsGenerator` class that implements the `DnsRecordsGenerator` interface  as well as a `DnsRecordsVerifier` class that implements the `IDnsRecordsVerifier` interface. These classes offer convenient methods for generating domain verification codes and verifying ownership through DNS records(TXT and CNAME)

### üîë DnsRecordsGenerator 

It can be injected into into your service class or controller using its interface or instantiated directly.

The `DnsRecordsGenerator` class provides the following methods:

#### `string GenerateDnsRecord(int length = 10)`

Generates a domain name verification code that users can add as TXT or CNAME records to prove ownership.

```csharp
string verificationCode = _dnsRecordsGenerator.GenerateDnsRecord(15);
```

#### `string GetTxtInstructions(string domainName, string verificationCode, TxtRecordSettings? options = null)`

This method provides users with instructions on adding the TXT record to their DNS for domain verification.

The `TxtRecordSettings` is a configuration class that includes the `Hostname` (representing the name of the TXT record) and `RecordAttribute` (optional content attribute of the TXT record). This configuration class is optional if the `DnsRecordsGenerator` has already been instantiated with the `DomainVerifierSettings`.

```csharp
const string domainNameToVerify = "the-domain-to-verify.com";
const string verificationCode = "randomcode"; // generated using GenerateDnsRecord()
var config = new TxtRecordSettings
{
	Hostname = "@", // or anything else but unique. example: _myappname-challenge-code 
	RecordAttribute = "my-appname-verification" // optional
};

string instructions = _dnsRecordsGenerator.GetTxtInstructions(domainNameToVerify, verificationCode, config)
```

> The verification code needs to be stored in the database alongside the corresponding domain name. Regarding configuration, placing it in the `appsettings.json` file is a straightforward option. However, it is crucial to ensure that the verification code remains constant as long as there are unverified domains stored in the database.

#### `string GetCnameInstructions(string verificationCode, CnameRecordSettings? options = null)`

This method serves the same purpose as the previous one but for CNAME records.

It provides users with instructions for adding the CNAME record to their DNS settings.

The `CnameRecordSettings` is a configuration class that includes the `RecordTarget` (representing the target of the CNAME record). This configuration class is also optional if the `DnsRecordsGenerator` has been instantiated with the `DomainVerifierSettings`.

```csharp
const string domainNameToVerify = "the-domain-to-verify.com";
const string verificationCode = "randomcode"; // generated using GenerateDnsRecord()
var config = new CnameRecordSettings("verify.myappname.com");

string instructions = _dnsRecordsGenerator.GetCnameInstructions(domainNameToVerify, verificationCode, config)
```



### üîçDnsRecordsVerifier

The `DnsRecordsVerifier` class is  a service designed to validate whether verification codes are configured in the DNS settings of a given domain name, thereby proving ownership.

It has two methods: `IsTxtRecordValidAsync` and `IsCnameRecordValidAsync`, which return true or false depending on whether the ownership is verified.

#### `async Task<bool> IsTxtRecordValidAsync(string domainName, string verificationCode, TxtRecordSettings? options = null)`

Asynchronously checks if the TXT record is valid for the specified domain and verification code.

```csharp
const string domainName = "the-domain-to-verify.com"; // retrieved from database
const string verificationCode = "randomcode"; // retrieved from database
var config = new TxtRecordSettings
{
	Hostname = "@", // Load from configurations
	RecordAttribute = "my-appname-verification" // Load from configurations
};

var isOwnershipVerified = await _dnsRecordsVerifier.IsTxtRecordValidAsync(domainName, verificationCode, config);

// Update your database to mark the domain as verified
```

#### `async Task<bool> IsCnameRecordValidAsync(string domainName, string verificationCode, CnameRecordSettings? options = null)`

Asynchronously checks if the CNAME record is valid for the specified domain and verification code.

```csharp
const string domainName = "the-domain-to-verify.com"; // retrieved from database
const string verificationCode = "randomcode"; // retrieved from database
var config = new CnameRecordSettings
{
	RecordTarget = "verify.myappname.com", // Load from configurations
};

var isOwnershipVerified = await _dnsRecordsVerifier.IsCnameRecordValidAsync(domainName, verificationCode, config);

// Update your database to mark the domain as verified
```

#### üåü Best Practices

- Optimize the verification process by executing it in the background using .NET hosted services or background services. Additionally, provide an endpoint that users can use to trigger the verification process.
- In scenarios where multiple users attempt to claim ownership of a specific domain, generate a unique verification code for each user. The rightful owner will be able to prove ownership using the respective code.



## DomainVerifier.Extensions (the recommended way)

`DomainVerifier.Extensions` project provides integration with [Dependency Injection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection)

You can use it by invoking the `AddDomainVerifierService` extension method on `IServiceCollection`. The configuration builder wraps various configuration properties with strongly-typed API. You can also configure properties using standard .NET `appsettings.json` inside configuration section `DomainVerifierSettings`.

### Instructions

**Step 1:** Install the `DomainVerifier.Extensions` [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DomainVerifier.Extensions) in your application.

```console
dotnet add package DomainVerifier.Extensions
```

**Step 2:** Add the verification configuration to your `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "DomainVerifierSettings": {
    "DnsServers": [ // Optional
      {
        "Name": "My Custom DNS Server Name",
        "IpAddress": "127.0.0.1",
        "Port": 53
      }
    ],
    "TxtRecordSettings": {
      "Hostname": "@",
      "RecordAttribute": "my-appname-verification"
    },
    "CnameRecordSettings": {
      "RecordTarget": "verify.myappname.com"
    }
  }
}
```

**Step 3:** Add the Domain verifier service to the service collection:

```csharp
services.AddDomainVerifierService(configuration);
```

`DnsRecordsGenerator` and `DnsRecordsVerifier` are already registered with the dependency injection containers.

### Usage:

Simply inject the `IDnsRecordsGenerator` or `IDnsRecordsVerifier` interface into your service class or controller.
